                Eleu is a Uruguayan DJ/producer. Since he was a child, he has
                been passionate about electronic music, listening to artists
                like Tiesto. It was this passion that led him to complete his DJ
                studies in 2019 and start his career, making his debut that same
                year and sharing the stage with important national and
                international artists such as Matt Sassari, Mt93, Cosani, and
                Coyu. He has also had the opportunity to spend time with these
                artists outside of the DJ booth and has learned a lot from
                artists like Metodi Hristov, Weska, Joyhauser, Nakadia, and The
                Yellow Heads. In 2020, he started producing music after taking
                Ableton classes with the Argentine producer Emaxx Cost. In 2022,
                he expanded his knowledge by studying FL Studio with the
                Uruguayan producer Galoop. As a result, he has been able to
                release music on labels from Germany, Russia, Spain, the
                Netherlands, Bulgaria, and more. This year, he had the most
                important release of his career on a globally recognized label.
                In the beginning, he was associated with progressive and melodic
                techno, which not only gives him versatility but also allows him
                to create unique moments in his sets that are filled with
                techno, which he likes to call Techno Clubber, and deep
                melodies. If you want to dance from start to finish, don't miss
                out on listening to Eleu.
