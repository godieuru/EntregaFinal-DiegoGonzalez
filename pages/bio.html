            Eleu is a Uruguayan DJ/producer. Since he was a child, he has been passionate
            about electronic music, listening to artists like Tiesto. It was this passion that led
            him to complete his DJ studies in 2019 and start his career, making his debut that
            same year and sharing the stage with important national and international artists
            such as Matt Sassari, Mt93, Cosani, and Coyu.
            He has also had the opportunity to
            spend time with these artists outside of the DJ booth and has learned a lot from
            artists like Metodi Hristov, Weska, Joyhauser, Nakadia, and The Yellow Heads.
            In 2020, he started producing music after taking Ableton classes with the Argentine
            producer Emaxx Cost.
            In 2022, he expanded his knowledge by studying FL Studio
            with the Uruguayan producer Galoop. As a result, he has been able to release
            music on labels from Germany, Russia, Spain, the Netherlands, Bulgaria, and
            more. This year, he had the most important release of his career on a globally
            recognized label.
            In the beginning, he was associated with progressive and melodic techno, which
            not only gives him versatility but also allows him to create unique moments in his
            sets that are filled with techno, which he likes to call Techno Clubber, and deep
            melodies.
            If you want to dance from start to finish, don't miss out on listening to Eleu.
